Aggregate and Math Functions
Calculate an average value from selected records

Relate the education information in CA Educational Attainment & Personal Income to the forecasted population data in California Population Projection by County, Age, Gender and Ethnicity to estimate educational demand from 2015 to 2060.

Notes:
Age in CA Educational… is in ranges. Age in California Population Projection is in exact integers. You’ll need to create a field in Projections that assigns Projections.Age to the range corresponding to the range in Educational.Age. For example, if Projections.Age = 20, that would correspond to Education.Age = "18 to 64"
Population in Ca Population projection is by County. Population in CA Educational is for entire California. You’ll need to aggregate the population from CA Population Projection. 
Use the aggregate sum of Male and Female per year. Also use the aggregate sum of race
