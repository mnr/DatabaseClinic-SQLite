# Problem 1 : Create a database

In this chapter, we’re asked to demonstrate the simplest of tasks - create a database and import a dataset. This basic operation will provide an introduction to this data tool.

We're to import the [California Population Projection by County, Age, and Ethnicity dataset for 2010-2060](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-population-projection-county-age-gender-and-ethnicity/resource/cd0453ba-a6db-4542#{}) available from the state of California’s Open Data Portal.

This may seem like a simple task, but it demonstrates a valuable lesson. The dataset is almost 250 Megabytes in size, and the format of the data in the downloaded file may not match up with the way their particular database management system stores that data.

## MNR Notes
I've solved this problem by hand using database tools. I'll demonstrate three tools: [SQLite Manager for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/), [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) and the [SQLite3 - the command line tool](https://sqlite.org/cli.html).
