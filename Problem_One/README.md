# Problem 1 : Create a database

This is a very simple exercise - import a csv file into a database. This basic operation will provide an introduction to this data tool.

We've been assigned to import a dataset provided by the California Government. This dataset is found [here as Import CA Population Projection by County, Age, Gender and Ethnicity, 2010-2060](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-population-projection-county-age-gender-and-ethnicity/resource/cd0453ba-a6db-4542#{})

I've solved this problem by hand using database tools. I'll demonstrate three tools: [SQLite Manager for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/), [DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) and the [SQLite3 - the command line tool](https://sqlite.org/cli.html).
