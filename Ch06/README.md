# Averages and Calculations

In this challenge, we are asked to forecast the educational demand for California up to the year 2060.

We are provided with two datasets:
1. [CA Educational Attainment & Personal Income](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/ca-educational-attainment-personal-income) will provide education information
2. [California Population Projection by County, Age, and Ethnicity dataset for 2010-2060](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-population-projection-county-age-gender-and-ethnicity/resource/cd0453ba-a6db-4542#{}) will provide population forecasts up to 2060.

We will have to link those datasets and create a table that forecasts the demand for each level of education for each year:

| Year | Educational Attainment | Actual or Forecast Demand |
|---|---|---|
| 2008 | "Children under 15" | A number equaling the population of this segment |
| 2008 | "No high school diploma" | A number equaling the population of this segment |
| 2008 | "High school or equivalent" | A number equaling the population of this segment |
| 2008 | "Some college, less than 4-yr degree" | A number equaling the population of this segment |
| 2008 | "Bachelor's degree or higher" | A number equaling the population of this segment |
