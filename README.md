# DatabaseClinic-SQLite

[Database Clinic](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?keywords=database%20clinic&u=104) is a series of courses from LinkedIn Learning that demonstrate the strengths, weaknesses and uses of various database systems. Each course consists of an author solving five common database problems through the use of their favorite data tool.

In addition to standard databases such as MySQL or MS-Access, Database Clinic also explores the use of tools not traditionally thought of as databases.

This specific example of Database Clinic uses [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/) to solve the problems. SQLite uses a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) and is built as a library that can be used from other applications. Typically, SQLite is used in mobile applications for lightweight data storage.  

I have also created programs in python and R to drive the SQLite database.

This series does not cover installation or maintenance - There are other LinkedIn Learning courses with that information. This course dives right in with how to implement and solve problems.
