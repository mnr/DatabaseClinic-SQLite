DB Clinic builds on the popular “Code Clinic” series but with a focus on databases. Each course will consist of five database problems solved by a different author using a database of their choice.

Members will learn pros and cons of each database, as well as tips and tricks for implementing solutions.

For those of you into reality shows, think of "Iron Chef" without the seafood.
