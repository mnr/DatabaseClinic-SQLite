# DatabaseClinic-SQLite


examples and solutions from Database Clinic for LinkedIn Learning

##

DB Clinic builds on the popular “Code Clinic” series but with a focus on databases. Each course will consist of five database problems solved by a different author using a database of their choice.

Members will learn pros and cons of each database, as well as tips and tricks for implementing solutions.

For those of you into reality shows, think of "Iron Chef" without the seafood.

Authors assume viewers will already have set up the technology on their machines. DO NOT cover administration, configuration, setup or installation of the database. We will provide links to courses with setup instructions.
Structure of the courses:
There will be a series of Code Clinic courses. Titled something along the lines of "Database Clinic: MySQL" or "Code Clinic: SQLite" or some such. The course itself will consist of an introductory chapter, followed by several solution chapters.
